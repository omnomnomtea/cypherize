# Cypherize

## Goal
To create a package which can be used similarly to Sequelize on the backend, but which connects a Cypher-based database (Neo4j) to the application instead of a SQL-based one like PostgreSQL.

## Usage
Don't use this yet, it's not ready!
Very very much in development still. Tests are being written, bugs are being found, etc. I'll update this readme when the basics are here.

## Caveats and warnings
- Key names for properties on a node/connection set using Cypherize must adhere to the following rules
  - Alphanumeric and underscore are the only characters allowed
